# WooCommerce Attribute Sets

A simple WordPress plugin that adds a basic attribute set functionality to WooCommerce.

## Disclaimer

I have been experimenting with angularjs, along with some WordPress approaches, so don't judge the code quality!

## Features

* Add some attributes to an attribute set.
* Add more than one attribute to a product with a click by choosing the attribute set.

## Roadmap

* Delete attributes from attribute set.
* Delete attribute sets.
* Some validations.
* When an attribute is added to an attribute set, adds it to products that have that set.
